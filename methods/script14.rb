# The combined comparison operator looks like this: <=>. It returns 0 if the first operand (item to be compared) equals the second, 1 if the first operand is greater than the second, and -1 if the first operand is less than the second.

book_1 = "A Wrinkle in Time"

book_2 = "A Brief History of Time"

puts book_2 <=> book_1
