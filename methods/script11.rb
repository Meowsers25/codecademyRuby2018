# A method can take a block as a parameter.

# Passing a block to a method is a great way of abstracting certain tasks from the method and defining those tasks when we call the method. Abstraction is an important idea in computer science, and you can think of it as meaning "making something simpler."

# using a block to define the task you want the method (like .each) to do simplifies the task at hand.

# The block, {|i| puts i}, is passed the current
# array item each time it is evaluated. This block
# prints the item. 
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].each { |i| puts i }

# This block prints the number 5 for each item.
# (It chooses to ignore the passed item, which is allowed.)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].each { |i| puts i * 5 }
