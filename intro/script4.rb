# There are six arithmetic operators we're going to focus on:

# Addition (+)

# Subtraction (-)

# Multiplication (*)

# Division (/)

# Exponentiation (**)

# Modulo (%)

# The only ones that probably look weird to you are exponentiation and modulo. Exponentiation raises one number (the base) to the power of the other (the exponent). For example, 2**3 is 8, since 2**3 means "give me 2 * 2 * 2" (2 multiplied together 3 times). 3**2 is 9 (3 * 3), and so on.

# Modulo returns the remainder of division. For example, 25 % 7 would be 4, since 7 goes into 25 three times with 4 left over.

puts 2 + 4
puts 25 % 7
puts 3 ** 4
puts 10 - 12
puts 12 * 2
puts 24 / 4
