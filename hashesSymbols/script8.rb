# Symbols are primarily used either as hash keys or for referencing method names. 

# Symbols make good hash keys for a few reasons:

# They're immutable, meaning they can't be changed once they're created

# Only one copy of any symbol exists at a given time, so they save memory

# Symbol-as-keys are faster than strings-as-keys because of the above two reasons.

# Add at least two more keys to the symbol_hash hash replacing the ______ blanks.

# The keys should all be symbols; their associated values can be anything you like.

symbol_hash = {
  :one => 1,
  :two => 2,    # Fill in these two blanks!
  :three => 3,
  :four => 4
}
