# The .object_id method gets the ID of an objectâ€”it's how Ruby knows whether two objects are the exact same object. Run the code in the editor to see that the two "strings" are actually different objects, whereas the :symbol is the same object listed twice.

puts "string".object_id
puts "string".object_id

puts :symbol.object_id
puts :symbol.object_id
